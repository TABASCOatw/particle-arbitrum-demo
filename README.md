    Particle Auth Core Arbitrum (Sepolia) Demo
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Full-stack demo application showcasing the implementation of Particle Auth Core (Particle Network's flagship Wallet-as-a-Service SDK) within applications built on Arbitrum Sepolia. Specifically, this demo facilitates social login, the assignment of a smart account, and the execution of a standard burn transaction (0.001 ETH).

This demo was made for the Arbitrum documentation.

üõ†Ô∏è Try the demo: https://particle-arbitrum-demo.replit.app

Built using **Particle Auth Core**, **TypeScript**, **Particle AA SDK**

## üîë Particle Auth Core
Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.
